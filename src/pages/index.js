        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <hr class="border-primary"></hr>
        <p>
          Welcome to DnD Crafting. This site is meant to help Dungeons and
          Dragons players and dungeon masters with crafting.
        </p>
        <h3>Locations</h3>
        <hr class="border-primary"></hr>
        <p>
          The players are travelling through the woods, and one of them says "I
          go foraging in the bushes". What do they find?
        </p>
        <p>
          The locations page keeps a list of different locations, and each
          location shows the ingredients that can be found there. Each
          ingredients has a rarity, making it easy for DMs to decide what the
          player finds.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipes</h3>
        <hr class="border-primary"></hr>
        <p>
          Each recipe contains the effects of the recipe, such as giving +1d4 on
          the next wisdom check, a list of ingredients needed, and other useful
          information.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <hr class="border-primary"></hr>
        <p>
          Each ingredients has a rarity, and a list of the recipes it can be
          used in.
        </p>
